# Compound Construction

![Docusaurus logo](/img/compound-construction.png)

After an 8 wave cycle ends, a similar cycle ensues, which is then followed by another 5 wave movement.

This develops a pattern of "one degree larger" than the waves of which it is composed.

The image above depicts a 5 wave pattern of larger degree that is corrected by a 3 wave patters (ABC) of the same degree, completing a larger full cycle.

Waves 1, 3 and 5 are motive waves that is made up of 5 waves.

Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves that must subdivide into 3 waves (ABC).

This pattern can be used to illustrate 2, 8, or 34 waves depending on the degree to which we are referring.
