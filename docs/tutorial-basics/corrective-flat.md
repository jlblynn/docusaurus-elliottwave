# Flat (3-3-5)

**Flat** is used to describe any ABC that subdivides into a 3-3-5 pattern.

In a **"regular flat"** correction, the first actionary A wave, lacks sufficient force to unfold into a full 5 waves.

The B wave reaction, inherits this lack of counter-trend pressure and terminates near the start of wave A.

Wave C generally terminates slightly beyond the end of wave A.

In a Bear market - just invert the patterns above.

The correction usually retraces less of the preceeding impulse wave than a zigzag does.

Tends to occur when the larger trend is strong, so usually after an extension.

The more powerful the underlying trend is, the shorted the correction.

Within an impulse, the 4th wave tends to sport a flat, while the secons wave rarely does.

The far more common **"expanded flat"** contains a price extreme that is beyond that of the preceeding impulse wave.

Wave B of the 3-3-5 pattern terminates beyond the starting level of wave A, and wave C ends further beyond the ending level of wave A.

A rare variation of the 3-3-5 is known as a **"running flat"**.

Wave B terminated well beyond the beginning of wave A (like an expanding flat), but wave C fails to travel its full distance, falling short of the level wave A ended.

The forces in the direction of the trend are so powerful that it skews in that direction.

If the B wave subdivides into 5 waves rather than 3, then it is more likely the first wave up of the impulse of the next higher degree.

The power of adjacent impulse waves is important in recognising running corrections, which tend to occur in strong and fast markets.

A **"running triangle"** is far more common.
