# Horizontal Triangle (Triangle)

Triangles appear to reflect a balance of forces, causing a sideways movement that is usually associated with **decreasing volume and volatility**.

The pattern contains five over-lapping waves that subdivide into 3-3-3-3-3 and are labelled A-B-C-D-E.

More often than not, wave E can under or overshoot the A-C line.

There are 2 varieties of triangles: **contracting and expanding**.

The Contracting variety has 3 types:
- symmetrical
- ascending
- descending

The rarer **expanding triangle** has no variations.

It is extremly common of wave B of a contracting triangle to exceed the start of wave A in what may be called a **running triangle**.

All triangles effect a net retracement of the preceeding wave at wave E's end.
