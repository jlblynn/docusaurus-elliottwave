title: Corrective Waves

# Corrective waves

Markets move against the trend of one greater degree only with a seeming struggle.

Resistance from the larger trend appears to prevent a correction from developing a full motive structure.

This struggle between the two opposing trending degrees generally makes corrective waves less clearly identifiable than motive waves, which always flow in the direction of the larger trend with general ease.

This makes corrective waves a bit more varied than motive waves.

They generally increase or decrease in complexity as they progress - technically subwaves of the same degree can by their complexity or time length appear to be of different degree.

It can be difficult to fit corrective waves into recognisable patterns, until they are completed.

Termination points for corrective waves are harder to predict. so you need flexibility in your analysis.

**Corrections are never 5's**. Only motive waves are 5's.

For this reason, **an initial 5 wave movement against the larger trend is never the end of a correction**.

There are2 corrective styles:
- Sharp
- Sideways

Specific corrective patterns:
- Zigzag (5-3-5; includes three types: songle, double, and triple)
- Flat (3-3-5; includes three types: regular, expanded, and running)
- Triangle (3-3-3-3-3; four types: {
  three of the contracting variety (ascending, descending, and symmetrical),
  one of the expanding variety (reverse symmetrical)
})
- Combination (two types: double three and triple three)
