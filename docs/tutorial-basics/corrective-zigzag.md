# Zigzag (5-3-5)

In a Bull market, a single Zigzag is a simple 3 wave ABC

- the subwave sequence is 5-3-5 and the top of the B wave is notably lower than the start of the A wave

In a Bear market, it is often referred to as an **inverted zigzag**

- occasionally, Zigzags will occur twice, or at most, three times in succession, particulary when the first one falls short of a normal target

- in these cases, each Zigzag is separated by an intervening "three", producing a "double zigzag" ot a "triple zigzag"

Within impulses, second waves frequently sport zigzags, while forth waves rarely do.

For intervening movements, label the successive actionary components od double and triple corrections as waves **W, Y, and Z** so the entire pattern is **W-X-Y(-X-Z)**.

**W** denotes the first corrective pattern in the double or triple correction.

**Y** for the second.

**Z** for the third of a triple.

Each subwave thereof is now properly seen as two degres smaller than the entire correction.

Each wave **X** is a reactionary wave and thus always a corrective wave, typically another zigzag.
