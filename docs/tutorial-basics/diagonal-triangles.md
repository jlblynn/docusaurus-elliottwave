# Diagonal Triangles

A motive pattern yet not an impulse, as it has 2 corrective characteristics.

They substitute for impulses at specific locations in the wave structure.

No reactionary subwave fully retraces the preceeding actionary subwave.
The 3rd subwave is never the shortest.

The only 5 wave structures in the direction of the main trend within which wave 4 almost always moves into the price territory of wave 1.

It is rare that a diagonal triangle may end in truncation.
