# Ending Diagonal

![Docusaurus logo](/img/ending-diagonal.png)

A special type of wave that occurs primarily in the 5th wave position at times when the proceeding wave has gone "too far and too fast".

Only a small percentage of ending diagonals appear in the C wave of ABC formations.

In double or triple 3's they appear only as the final C wave.

In all cases, **they are found at the termination points of larger patterns**, indicating and exhaustion of the larger movement.

They take a wedge-shape, and each subwave including 1, 3, and 5, subdivides into a "three", which is a  corrective wave phenomenon producing an overall count of 3-3-3-3-3.

Volume tends to diminish as a triangle of small degree progresses, the patern always ends with a spike of relativel high volume when a **thowover** occurs.
A thowover often occurs and is when a diagonal triangle ends with a brief break in the trendline connecting the end points of waves 1 and 3.

On rare occasions, the 5th subwave falls short of its resistance trendline.

**A rising diagonal is bearish** and is usually followed by sharp decline retracing at least back to the level where it began.

**A falling diagonal is bullish**.

**[5th wave extensions](../tutorial-basics/impulse-extension)**, **[truncated fifths](../tutorial-basics/impulse-truncation)**, and **[diagonal triangles](../tutorial-basics/diagonal-triangles)** all imply a **dramatic reversal ahead**.
