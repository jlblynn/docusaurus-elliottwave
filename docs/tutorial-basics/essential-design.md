# The Essential Design

**The Corrective Pattern**

Downward waves A and C are composed of 5 waves.

Upward wave B is made up of 3 waves.

- this highlights that motive waves do not always point upward and corrective waves do not always point downward

The mode of a wave is determined by its relative direction.
Waves divide in motive mode (5 waves) when trending in the same direction as the wave of one larger degree of which it is part.
In corrective mode (3 waves or a variation) when trending in the opposite direction.

Waves A and C are motive, trending in the same direction as wave 2.
Wave B is corrective because it corrects wave A and is a counter-trend to wave 2.

Action in the same direction as the one larger trend develops in 5 waves, while reaction against the one larger trend develops in 3 waves, at all degrees of a trend

There is no finality, this larger cycle simply becomes 2 subdivisions of the wave of the next higher degree.
