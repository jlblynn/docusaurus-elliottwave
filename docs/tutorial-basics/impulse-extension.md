# Impulse - Extension

Most impulses contain an extension.

An elongated impulse with exaggerated subdivisions.

The vast majority of impulses contain an extension in one and only one of their 3 actionary subwaves.

At times, the subdivisions of the extended wave are nearly the same amplitude and duration as the other 4 waves of the larger impulse, giving a total count of 9 waves of similar size.

Knowing this, it can help predict the length of the coming waves.
For example, if the 1st and 3rd waves are about equal in length, the 5th wave will likely be the protracted surge.
Or if wave 3 extends, the 5th should be similar size to wave 1.

The most commonly extended is wave 3.

Wave 3 is never the shortest actionary wave, and wave 4 may never overlap wave 1.
It is common practise to assume the third wave will be the extended one.

The 5th wave is rarely the impulse wave unless it's a bull market, and impulse waves can have impulse waves within them.
