# Leading Diagonal

When diagonal triangles occur in the wave 5 or C position, they take the 3-3-3-3-3 shape (see above).

However, another variation occasionaly appears in the wave 1 position of impulses and in the wave A position of zigzags.

With the overlapping of waves 1 and 4 and the convergance of boundary lines into a wedge.

However, the subdivisions are different, tracing out a 5-3-5-3-5 pattern.

The structure of this formation has 5 wave subdivisions of the actionary waves communicating a "continuation" message as opposed to the "termination" implication of the 3 wave subdivisions in the actionary waves of the ending diagonal.
It's easy to mistake this for a series of 1st and 2nd waves.

To detect this, notice the slowing of price change in the 5th subwave relative to the 3rd.

By contrast, in developing 1st and 2nd waves, short term speed typically increases, and breadth often expands.
